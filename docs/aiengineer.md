### ðŸ›  Key Insights & Adjustments

* **Prompt Engineering** is now an indispensable skill: institutional training programs (like JPMorganâ€™s) reflect its priority ([ciodive.com][4]).
* **Orchestration frameworks** (LangChain, LangGraph) are now mainstream in enterprise AI workflows ([medium.com][5]).
* **Prompt injection** is a top emerging threatâ€”must be included under security ([en.wikipedia.org][6]).
* **Agent & Multimodal systems** are growing, but still earlyâ€”tagged as optional/future.
* **Monitoring, cost efficiency** are core MLOps concerns and required for sustainable model deployment ([en.wikipedia.org][7]).

### âœ… Final Takeaway

Build in this order:

1. **Core fundamentals** (math, software, ML basics)
2. **Applied building blocks** (datasets, prompt, RAG, infra)
3. **Production excellence** (optimizations, cost, security, observability)
4. **Future-readiness** (agents, multimodal, responsible AI, product UX)
