# AI Engineer Learning Path: From Software to AI Engineer

This repository contains a comprehensive, self-paced learning guide designed for mid-level software engineers looking to transition into AI engineering, with a specific focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

## Overview

This guide provides a structured 3-4 month curriculum, covering fundamental AI/ML concepts, advanced LLM techniques, full-stack AI development, LLMOps, and agentic AI. It emphasizes hands-on learning through practical projects and includes resources, quizzes, and detailed explanations to ensure a thorough understanding of each topic.

## Contents

### 1. The AI Engineer Learning Guide

This is the core document outlining the entire learning path. It's structured into weekly modules, allowing you to skip sections you're already familiar with. Each module includes:

- **Learning Objectives:** What you will learn.
- **Core Concepts:** Detailed explanations of key theories and principles.
- **Learning Resources:** Curated links to articles, videos, courses, and documentation.
- **Hands-on Exercises/Mini-Projects:** Small coding tasks to reinforce understanding.
- **Quizzes:** Self-assessment questions to test your knowledge.
- **Illustration Descriptions:** Placeholders and descriptions for visual aids to enhance understanding.

### 2. Consolidated Hands-on Projects

This document compiles all the hands-on projects mentioned throughout the learning guide. These projects are designed to provide practical, applied learning experience, ranging from basic LLM API integration to building complex multi-agent systems and deploying full-stack AI applications.

Each project includes:

- **Overview:** A brief description of the project.
- **Learning Objectives:** Specific skills you will gain.
- **Technical Requirements:** Tools and libraries needed.
- **Project Scope:** Estimated duration and difficulty.
- **Implementation Steps:** A step-by-step guide to building the project.
- **README Template:** A ready-to-use `README.md` structure for your project repository.
- **Key Learning Outcomes:** What you should master after completing the project.
