# Generative AI Resources Repository

Welcome to **My Generative AI Resources** repository! This is a personal collection of articles, papers, tools, and various resources related to Generative AI that I encounter day-to-day. The goal is to organize and store everything in one place for easy access and future reference.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

To keep things organized, resources are categorized by type. This will help me quickly find what I need without having to sift through a large list. As new resources are added, categories may be expanded or refined.

### Current Categories

1. [**Blogs**](/docs/Blogs.md)
   - Blogs covering the latest models and techniques in Generative AI
  
2. **[Youtube videos / learning resources](/docs/youtube.md)**
   - Youtube videos and turorials.
  
3. **AI Engineer Roadmap**
   [**AI Engineer Roadmap**](/docs/aiengineer.md)
   [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ai-engineer)

4. **Personal/Insights**

   [What it takes to build a Generative AI based application.](https://medium.com/@siddharthchopda03/what-it-takes-to-build-a-generative-ai-based-application-720e8c0b8b5f)

5. **Courses**
  - Find the best AI related courses on [Deeplearning.ai](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/)
### Example Entry Format

When adding new resources, I'll follow this structure to maintain consistency:

```markdown
### [Title of the Resource](URL)
**Description:** Brief overview of what the resource covers or its significance.
**Category:** Choose from the categories listed above.
```

## üìå Personal Notes

- This repository is mainly for **my personal reference**, and may not be as polished as a public project.
- I'll regularly update it as I come across new resources.
- As of now, this repository is private, but I might decide to share it publicly later if I think it's useful for others.
