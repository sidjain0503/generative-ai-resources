# Generative AI Resources Repository

Welcome to **My Generative AI Resources** repository! This is a personal collection of articles, papers, tools, and various resources related to Generative AI that I encounter day-to-day. The goal is to organize and store everything in one place for easy access and future reference.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

To keep things organized, resources are categorized by type. This will help me quickly find what I need without having to sift through a large list. As new resources are added, categories may be expanded or refined.

### Current Categories

1. **Blogs**
   - Blogs covering the latest models and techniques in Generative AI
  
2. **Youtube videos / learning resources**
   - Youtube videos and turorials. 
4. **Personal Views / insights**
   

### Example Entry Format

When adding new resources, I'll follow this structure to maintain consistency:

```markdown
### [Title of the Resource](URL)
**Description:** Brief overview of what the resource covers or its significance.
**Category:** Choose from the categories listed above.
```

## 📌 Personal Notes

- This repository is mainly for **my personal reference**, and may not be as polished as a public project.
- I'll regularly update it as I come across new resources.
- As of now, this repository is private, but I might decide to share it publicly later if I think it's useful for others.
